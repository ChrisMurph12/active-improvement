# Active Improvement

Active Improvement is real company. It sells high quality but simple gym supplements to gym users. The supplements can be taken by complete novices or by experienced athletes. The site's aim is to explain the benefits of each of its supplements in simple terms so that people understand what they are buying.

Active includes instructions on when, why and how to use each product to help boost somebody's training and "Actively Improve" their all round fitness, health & wellness.

## Site Owner Goals
- Stress the importance of not spending too much money on pointless supplements that won't do anything to help the user.
- Identify the supplemets that can make a difference, and then break each one down to explain what they are, and their benefits.
- Keep the website simple. If the website is too complex, it negates the message of simplicity that the owner is trying to put forward.
- Encourage users to ask questions to get accurate advice.

## User Stories
- ### First Time User
  - As a first time user I want to gain some knowledge of how to save some money when buying supplements.
  - As a first time user I want to understand which products would help me achieve my goals.
  - As a first time user I want to understand WHY these chosen products would help me more than others

### Returning User
  - As a returning user I want to ask some more questions that will help mem on my journey.
  - As a returning user I want to find out how I can purchase these products.

## Design

### Imagery
The imagery used is extremely simplistic which is important to the user experience. We want them to not be overwhelmed by lots of pictures. WE keep it simple and only have 4 pictures on the site. The hero image, which is a selection of all of our products. A protein image, a pre-workout image, and a creatine image.

### Colours
The colour scheme is white and green. People associate green with healthy, so this seemed like the obvious choice of colour. The white then keeps the site looking simple and clean, allowing the font to be easily readable.

### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq.
